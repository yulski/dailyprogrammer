# [[2017-10-09] Challenge #335 [Easy] Consecutive Distance Rating](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/759fha/20171009_challenge_335_easy_consecutive_distance/)

## Description
We'll call the consecutive distance rating of an integer sequence the sum of the distances between consecutive integers. Consider the sequence 1 7 2 11 8 34 3. 1 and 2 are consecutive integers, but their distance apart in the sequence is 2. 2 and 3 are consecutive integers, and their distance is 4. The distance between 7 and 8 is 3. The sum of these distances is 9.

Your task is to find and display the consecutive distance rating of a number of integer sequences.
